# Frontend Mentor - Time tracking dashboard

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

This project is a challenge from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io), where I built a dashboard for time tracking.

## Technologies Used

- **Tailwind CSS**: Used exclusively for styling, providing a new approach with utility-first CSS.
- **TypeScript**: This project was my first experience using TypeScript, which presented a rewarding challenge. It improved type safety and code clarity, enhancing the development process.
